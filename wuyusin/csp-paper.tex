\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

Our goal is to apply duckiebot on blind navigation. The original duckiebot runs according to the yellow and white lines on the road. We are going to improve the oringinal duckiebot. The advanced duckiebot can find where the road is, and lead blind people safely. We hope that the blind people's action won't be limited anymore.

Depth Line Detector will replace the original line detector and groud projection, the input of Depth Line Detector is pointcloud, the output of Depth Line Detector is line segments.

\subsection{EQUIPMENTS} 

You should list the hardware which is necessary in your project. Your project will only become For example, duckiebot with a gripper Fig.~\ref{figure:duckiebot_gripper}.

\section{SPECIFIC AIMS}

(individual part)

Specific aims need to be concrete enough, so that it is clear what will be the expected outcomes of this work. You also need a reasonable scope that you could finish in this semester.

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Aim 1.
\item Specific Aim 2.
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}

(individual part)

This section should include the methods that you will need in order to reach the specific aims. You could include how you will implement your software/hardware, the design of the algorithms. Some preliminary results will be helpful as well. 

You may also state what experiments you will carry out to convince the readers that you reach the specific aims.

\section{SCHEDULE AND TEAM COLLABORATION}

(individual part)

In this section you should write a estimated timeline of your project. This schedule will be very crucial to keep up progress for your project. If you are in a team, you're encouraged to add other team members' on the timeline. It will better show the coordination of your team.
   

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
