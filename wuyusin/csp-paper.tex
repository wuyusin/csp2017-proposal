\section{INTRODUCTION \& MOTIVATION}

Our goal is to apply duckiebot on blind navigation. The original duckiebot runs according to the yellow and white lines on the road. We are going to improve the oringinal duckiebot. The advanced duckiebot can find where the road is, and lead blind people safely. We hope that the blind people's action won't be limited anymore.

Depth Line Detector will replace the original line detector and groud projection, the input of Depth Line Detector is pointcloud, the detector will detect two walls on both side of road, than transform walls into line segments which represent the derection of road, the output of Depth Line Detector is line segments.

\subsection{EQUIPMENTS} 

You should list the hardware which is necessary in your project. Your project will only become For example, duckiebot with a gripper Fig.~\ref{figure:duckiebot_gripper}.

\section{SPECIFIC AIMS}

Specific aims need to be concrete enough, so that it is clear what will be the expected outcomes of this work. You also need a reasonable scope that you could finish in this semester.

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific Aim 1.
\item Specific Aim 2.
\end{itemize}

\section{APPROACH}
\begin{itemize}

\item Approach of aim 1.

\begin{figure}[h] % h means put this image here

\end{figure}
1.Wall filtering : Compute the normal of every point, keep points whose normal is horizontal(these points may be the wall part), filter out points whose normal is vertical(these points may be floor or something else).

2.Project wall points : We now have 3D points of wall, but with these points, we can't determine which way to go. So we need to project the wall to x-y plane, then form 2D discrete points. these points imply the trend of wall.  

3.RANSAC line fitting : Model the 2D points into a best line.

\caption{Fitted line with RANSAC; outliers have no influence on the result.}
\end{figure}

4. Split map : Because the road happens to be curved, we need to split the line, so we can get straight line segments.

\item Approach of aim 2.


\end{itemize}

\section{SCHEDULE AND TEAM COLLABORATION}

(individual part)

In this section you should write a estimated timeline of your project. This schedule will be very crucial to keep up progress for your project. If you are in a team, you're encouraged to add other team members' on the timeline. It will better show the coordination of your team.
   

\addtolength{\textheight}{-12cm}   % This command serves to balance the column lengths
                                  % on the last page of the document manually. It shortens
                                  % the textheight of the last page by a suitable amount.
                                  % This command does not take effect until the next page
                                  % so it should come on the page before the last. Make
                                  % sure that you do not shorten the textheight too much.
